# Infernomoo Soundpack
This is a soundpack for [infernoMoo](https://www.mudconnect.com/cgi-bin/search.cgi?mode=mud_listing&mud=InfernoMOO) written for the [mushclient](http://www.gammon.com.au/downloads/dlmushclient.htm) mudclient. It is recommended that you download the light version of the [mush-z alter aeon pack](http://download.mush-z.com/alter-aeon-mush-z-lite.exe) first as it contains everything needed to get the client working with screen readers. Put this folder inside the worlds folder of your mushclient installation. The following keystrokes are useful:
* alt 1-0 reads messages from a channel category (radio, chatnet etc.)
* alt left/right arrows changes the focused channel category.
* f5 and f6 to change volume of music, ambience, and sound volume
* f7 selects which of the above three will be changed when pressing f5 or f6
Much of this pack was put together by Mata and Sneak, though they are not maintaining it and are being included for historical purposes only.
Have fun!
